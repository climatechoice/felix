1)Error with RANDOM POISSON

Change this

Poisson Arrivals=RANDOM POISSON(Minimum Number of Extreme Events,
Maximum Number of Extreme Events,
Extreme Event Mean,
Poisson Distribution Shift,
Poisson Distribution Stretch,
S Stream ID)	Events/Year

to just a mupltiplication

Poisson Arrivals=Minimum Number of Extreme Events*Maximum Number of Extreme Events*Extreme Event Mean*Poisson Distribution Shift*Poisson Distribution Stretch*S Stream ID Events/Year


2) Rename
Population 65+ -> Population 65 plus

Prevalence (model-based) -> Prevalence model-based

Share of females aged 20-39 with sec+ education -> Share of females aged 20-39 with sec plus education

Survivors in interval x x+5 -> Survivors in interval x x plus 5

65+ -> 65 plus

3)Error with DELAY1 functions
The error: build/processed.c:12726:58: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('double' and 'double[4][2]') _potential_vegetarians[i][j][k] = (__level152[i][j][k] / __aux71[i]);

Change this

Potential vegetarians[Gender,Cohorts,Education]=
	DELAY1I("Meat-based Diet Followers"[Gender,Cohorts,Education], 1, "Initial Meat-based Diet Followers"\
		[Gender,Cohorts,Education])
	~	People
	~		|

to a constant number for the time being

Potential vegetarians[Gender,Cohorts,Education]=
	100
	~	People

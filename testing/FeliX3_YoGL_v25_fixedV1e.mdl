	~	Here, we assume that caloric value of per gram of alternative proteins is \
		similar to the caloric value of animal source foods. This assumption is \
		based on the fact that caloric value of alternative proteins is almost the \
		same as conventional protein. For microbial protein and cultivated meat, \
		it is because the same type of proteins and fat content is created, so \
		leads to the same caloric values, For plant-based alternatives, the \
		products sampled in the US market (Table 1 in OECD (2022) Meat Protein \
		Alternatives) and in the Dutch market by me report caloric values per 100 \
		gr similar to those of conventional counterparts. Therefore, we assume \

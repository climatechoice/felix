	~	Here, we assume that caloric value of per gram of alternative proteins is \
		similar to the caloric value of animal source foods. This assumption is \
		based on the fact that caloric value of alternative proteins is almost the \
		same as conventional protein. For microbial protein and cultivated meat, \
		it is because the same type of proteins and fat content is created, so \
		leads to the same caloric values, For plant-based alternatives, the \
		products sampled in the US market (Table 1 in OECD (2022) Meat Protein \
		Alternatives) and in the Dutch market by me report caloric values per 100 \
		gr similar to those of conventional counterparts. Therefore, we assume \

	~	Ton/Ton
	~	This parameter represents the crop demand of each alternative protein \
		(replacing beef, pork, poultry, eggs, milk) by each AP technology. For \
		cultivated meat, only PasMeat and CropMeat can be replaced, requiring \
		soybeans and corn. For precision fermentation, all can be replaced, \
		requiring only sugar cane. For plant-based alternatives, all except eggs \
		are replaced, based on average recipes. See "New_DietData.xlsx/Alt protein \
		type vs tech" for the estimation of these parameters and their uncertainty \
		ranges.

Conventional to alternative protein conversion factor[AltProteinTech]=
	1, 0.73, 1
	~	Dmnl
	~	This parameter represents how much of the alternative protein is required \
		to replace the conventional protein. For plant-based and cultivated meat, \
		it is assumed to be 1, since for plant-based alternatives, the recipes are \
		designed accordingly and for cultivated meat, it is the same protein type. \
		For microbial protein, due to the protein and moisture content, Humpenoder \
		(2022) calculates that 1 dry-matter ton of meat can be replaced by 0.73 DM \
		ton of microbial protein.

The purple variables are new additions to the Diet Change version. Those ending with 'variation' are used for sensitivity analysis. Those ending with 'indicator' are used for SSP calibration. Other purple vaiables are for unit conversion according to SSP projections. Light purples are their shadow variables.

When we vary the age-specific fertility rates, we need to make sure that the total ASFR is TF, i.e. by setting one of the cohorts to the total TF-all others. In fact, it is population weighted.

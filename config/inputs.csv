### Overview
This scenario enables the exploration of diets exogenously, examining the impact of the world transitioning towards a specific diet type, which allows for the exploration of a wide range of impacts across health and the environment.

### Reference Data
Here, we provide four dietary compositions in terms of their **caloric composition**, based on the FeliX Model's eight food categories:


- **Reference Diet**: Represents a baseline or current average dietary intake, based on FAO Diet Composition Statistics ([FAO, 2013](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FBS)) calibrated for this analysis  
- **Healthy Diet**: Updated plant-forward diet with adjusted caloric proportions, based on [WHO Healthy Diet Guidelines](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/healthy-diet) estimated by [Springmann et al. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0594-0) 
- **Mediterranean Diet**: Plant-forward with olive oil, grains, fruits, and modest meat and dairy, estimated based on general dietary guidelines  
- **Flexitarian Diet**: Mostly plant-based with moderate amounts of animal products, estimated based on general dietary guidelines

### Overview and Structure
This **Diet Change Population Dynamics Scenario** explores how population-level dietary behaviour evolves through social and psychological drivers, with implications for global consumption patterns and its environmental impacts. 

Eker et al. (2019) adopt two main feedback mechanisms in the diet change module, grounded in two complementary psychological theories. 

**Social transmission**, is based on the **Theory of Planned Behavior** ([Ajzen, 1991](https://doi.org/10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-T)), which posits that behavioral intentions are shaped by perceived behavioral control (or self-efficacy), subjective social norms, and individual attitudes-i.e., whether a behavior is evaluated positively or negatively. In this context, diet change driven by social norms forms a **positive feedback loop**: as more individuals adopt a vegetarian diet, the social norm shifts, which in turn further encourages diet change.

**Willingness to change**, draws on the **Protection Motivation Theory** ([Boer & Seydel, 1996](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1996-97268-004)), where behavior is determined by two types of appraisal: threat appraisal, the individual's evaluation of the severity of a threat, and coping appraisal, the perceived ability and willingness to manage the threat. In this context, the threat appraisal of climate change risk forms a negative feedback loop, where the diet shift to vegetarianism leads to lower emissions, fewer climate events and a lower threat.

### Scenario Inputs

The model incorporates several key scenario inputs that represent the key factors influencing the feedbacks as explained above:

- **Self-efficacy**: individuals' confidence in their ability to adopt a more sustainable diet  
- **Response efficacy**: belief that dietary change will lead to meaningful environmental or health benefits  
- **Perceived risks**: awareness of the consequences of consumption on health and climate  
- **Social norms**: the influence of the dietary behaviors of others within a social group  

Each of these input factors differ across population groups based on characteristics such as gender, education level, and age. This variation reflects how different segments of the population perceive their capability, expected benefits, risks, and social influences, which collectively shape patterns of dietary change.


---

### Findings
The findings show that **social norms** and **self-efficacy** are the most influential drivers of widespread dietary change. As more individuals adopt plant-based diets, a tipping point can be reached through social reinforcement, accelerating the transition. This underscores the importance of value-driven actions and group identity over purely risk-based motivations in shaping global dietary patterns and reducing the environmental impacts of the food system.",Primary,Sliders,0,200,100,25,%,.0f,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

### Overview
Food loss and waste occur across the entire food supply chain - from initial production to final consumption. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), **food loss** refers to the decrease in edible food mass that takes place during production, post-harvest, and processing stages - primarily due to infrastructural, logistical, or technical constraints. In contrast, **food waste** occurs at the retail and consumption stages and is often driven by behavioral or economic factors, such as over-purchasing, portion sizes, or the discarding of food that is still safe and edible ([FAO, 2014](http://www.fao.org/platform-food-loss-waste)).

Earlier stages of the supply chain (e.g., primary production and post-harvest) are typically more prone to **food loss**, while the later stages - particularly **consumption** - are where **food waste** is most prevalent. Each stage presents both challenges and opportunities for reducing inefficiencies and improving the sustainability of food systems.


(1) **Primary Production.** This is the stage where crops are harvested or animals are raised for food. *Losses occur due to:*  
- Pests, diseases, or extreme weather  
- Harvesting inefficiencies (e.g., overripe or underripe crops left behind)  
- Market or price fluctuations (e.g., food not harvested due to low market value)  
- Cosmetic standards (produce rejected due to shape/appearance)  


(2) **Post-Harvest Handling & Storage.** This is the stage where food is collected, sorted, cleaned, and stored before further processing or transport. *Losses occur due to:*  
- Poor storage conditions (e.g., lack of refrigeration or pest protection)  
- Inadequate infrastructure (e.g., damaged transport, lack of cooling)  
- Delays that reduce freshness, especially for perishables  

(3) **Processing & Packaging.** This is the stage where raw food is transformed into consumer-ready products (e.g., milling, canning, freezing). *Losses occur due to:*  
- Trimming and processing waste (e.g., peels, bones, offcuts)  
- Equipment inefficiencies or downtime  
- Quality control rejections  
- Overproduction or batch spoilage  

(4) **Distribution & Retail.** This is the stage where food is transported to retailers and sold to consumers. *Losses occur due to:*  
- Damage during transport (e.g., spoilage, packaging failure)  
- Inadequate temperature control (cold chain issues)  
- Overstocking and expired goods at retail  
- Rejection of items that don't meet aesthetic or size standards  


(5) **Consumption.** This is the stage where food is purchased, prepared, and eaten by consumers or served in food services. *Waste occurs due to:*  
- Over-purchasing or improper storage at home  
- Confusion over """"best before"""" and """"use by"""" labels  
- Plate waste in households, restaurants, and cafeterias  
- Cultural preferences and lack of awareness about waste ""

### Formulation
To estimate food loss and waste across the supply chain, we utilize data from Cecilia et al. ([2019](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-10961-5_11])), which derives loss and waste proportions based on FAO statistics.

Food losses and waste occur at various stages of the supply chain and differ depending on the type of food. This formula calculates the final food waste and loss for each food category by adjusting for variations within supply chain segments and accounting for their respective contributions:


$$
\text{FWL}_{\text{food}} = \text{FWLVar}_{\text{supplychain}} \times \text{FWLShare}_{\text{supplychain, food}}
$$

**Where:**

- $\text{FWL}_{\text{food}}$: Final food waste and loss for a specific food category (food)  
- $\text{FWLVar}_{\text{supplychain}}$: Variation factor in the supply chain segment (expressed as a multiplier, e.g., 1.1 for +10%)  
- $\text{FWLShare}_{\text{supplychain, food}}$: Share (proportion) of the supply chain segment's contribution to the food waste and loss in the food category (between 0 and 1)

### Overview
Food loss and waste vary significantly across different food categories due to their unique characteristics, production processes, and resource requirements. Understanding these differences is crucial for targeting effective interventions and reducing the overall environmental impact of the food system. 

1. **Pasture Meat** : Meat from animals raised on grasslands, such as beef and lamb. These meats have a higher environmental impact due to extensive land and water use. Losses at the production stage can be particularly impactful given the long growth cycles and resource intensity.

2. **Crop Meat**: Meat from animals primarily fed on crops like soy and corn, including chicken and pork. Generally, they have a lower environmental footprint than pasture meats but are vulnerable to losses during harvesting, processing, and distribution due to perishability and storage challenges.

3. **Dairy**: Products made from milk, such as cheese, yogurt, and butter. Dairy farming contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions and water usage. Dairy products are highly perishable, making spoilage a major cause of loss in processing, transport, and retail stages.

4. **Eggs**: A nutrient-rich food source from poultry, including chicken, duck, and quail eggs. Eggs have a lower environmental impact compared to meat but still require feed, water, and careful handling to minimize breakage and spoilage across the supply chain.

5. **Pulses**: Protein-rich plant foods like lentils, beans, and chickpeas. Pulses improve soil health and have a low carbon footprint. Their longer shelf life makes them less prone to loss, though storage and processing conditions can still cause losses.

1. **Grains**  
Staple crops such as wheat, rice, corn, and oats. These are essential for global food security but some require high water usage and are susceptible to losses during harvesting and storage due to pests, moisture, or poor infrastructure.

1. **Vegetables and Fruits**  
A diverse group including leafy greens, root vegetables, and berries. Generally have a lower environmental impact, but their perishability leads to high losses and waste throughout harvesting, transport, storage, and consumption stages. Transport and refrigeration also contribute to their environmental footprint.

1. **Other Crops**  
Includes foods like nuts, sugar, and oils (palm, soybean, canola). Some, especially tropical crops like palm oil, have significant land-use impacts. Losses vary widely depending on processing complexity and storage conditions.

### Formulation

To estimate baseline food loss and waste across major food categories, we apply average loss rates based on FAO data ([FAO, 2015](https://www.fao.org/save-food/news-and-multimedia/news/news-details/en/c/320086/)). These values represent the proportion of food that is lost or wasted across the supply chain for each category.

The food waste and loss per category is estimated as:

\text{FLW}_{\text{food}} = \text{TotalSupply}_{\text{food}} \times \text{FLWRate}_{\text{food}}
$$

**Where:**

- $\text{FLW}_{\text{food}}$: Estimated food waste and loss for a given food category  
- $\text{TotalSupply}_{\text{food}}$: Total supply of that food category  
- $\text{FLWRate}_{\text{food}}$: Average food loss and waste rate for that category (from FAO data)

### Overview and Structure 
The **Alternative Protein Scenario** explores the transition from traditional animal-based proteins to alternative protein technologies. The scenario highlights the technological influences of food production and how they cascade through the agricultural system to influence land use. It allows the exploration of different adoption trajectories and their implications for food system sustainability.

This scenario is structured around four key stages:

1. **Replacement Demand of Animal Proteins with Alternative Proteins**: This are scenario inputs, determining the changing market share of animal proteins replaced by alternative proteins (by 2050 and 2100).
	* *Animal-based proteins*: [Pasture-based Meat, Crop-based Meat, Dairy, Eggs]
	* *See below for Replacement Matrix
2. **Replacement Supply of Alternative Protein Technologies**: This are also scenario input, being able to control the proportion of each animal food that can be met by developing AP technologies.
	* *Plant-based Proteins* (e.g. soy, pulses, grains)
	* *Precision Fermentation* (e.g. microbial fermentation to produce dairy and egg analogs)
	* *Cultivated Meat* (e.g. lab-grown muscle cells)
	* *See below for Replacement Matrix
3. **Changing Caloric Demand for Food**: This will be part of the direct ouputs, determining demand for different food categories after replacing animal food with crops that are used for Alternative Proteins technology.
   * *See below for estimated crop demands for each AP types
4. **Impacts**: Finally, we examine the wide range of impacts, particularly land use.

> *Note*: Plant-based and precision fermentation primarily replace processed foods and ingredient-based uses, while cultivated meat can begin to replace certain whole cuts and **center-of-plate products.

**Feedstock and Crop Demand for Alternative Proteins**

Each technology type shifts demand toward specific crop categories:
- **Plant-based**: Pulses (peas, lentils), grains (soy, wheat), vegetable oils
- **Precision Fermentation**: Sugars (glucose, sucrose), microbial substrates (e.g. starches)
- **Cultivated Meat**: Sugars, amino acids, growth media (often derived from maize, sugarcane, or soy)",Secondary,Sliders,0,100,0,100,-,.0f,,100,200,,,No APs,Reference Goals,,,,,,,

Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) are greenhouse gas concentration trajectories adopted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for its **Fifth Assessment Report (AR5)** in 2014. They serve as standardized scenarios for climate modeling and research, facilitating comparisons across studies by providing consistent assumptions about future **radiative forcing**  -  the difference between incoming solar radiation and the energy radiated back to space  -  measured in **watts per square meter (W/m2)** by the year 2100.

## The Four RCPs

The RCPs are named according to their radiative forcing levels in 2100:

- **RCP2.6**. A stringent mitigation scenario leading to a radiative forcing of **2.6 W/m2**. It assumes aggressive emissions reductions, including negative emissions technologies like carbon dioxide removal. It is the only RCP consistent with keeping global warming likely below 2 DegC above pre-industrial levels.

- **RCP4.5**. A stabilisation scenario where radiative forcing stabilizes at **4.5 W/m2** after 2100. It assumes that emissions peak around 2040 and then decline due to moderate mitigation efforts.

- **RCP6.0**. Another stabilization pathway, reaching **6.0 W/m2** by 2100. This scenario assumes more delayed and modest mitigation compared to RCP4.5.

- **RCP8.5**. A high-emissions, business-as-usual scenario, leading to **8.5 W/m2** by 2100. It assumes continued growth in greenhouse gas emissions without additional climate policies. RCP8.5 was initially intended to represent a worst-case baseline but is increasingly viewed as less plausible given recent trends in energy and emissions.

## Purpose and Application

The RCPs are **not forecasts or predictions**. Instead, they provide *plausible futures* for climate modeling, helping researchers explore the potential outcomes of different emissions pathways. They are used as inputs to **Earth System Models (ESMs)**, which simulate the physical climate system under each scenario.

Each RCP includes not just CO? concentrations, but also data on other greenhouse gases, aerosols, land use changes, and atmospheric chemistry. This comprehensive framework allows for integrated assessment of how climate change might affect physical systems, ecosystems, and human societies.

## Transition to SSP-RCP Framework

In more recent work, particularly the **Sixth Assessment Report (AR6)**, the RCPs have been paired with **Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)** to create a more integrated framework known as the **SSP-RCP matrix**. This combination allows for exploring how socioeconomic developments (like population, GDP, or technological change) interact with climate outcomes.""",Secondary,Sliders,0,5,3,1,-,.0f,,1,2,3,4,RCP1.9,RCP2.6,RCP3.4,RCP4.5,RCP6,RCP8.5,,,

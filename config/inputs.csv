This table provides four dietary patterns in terms of their **caloric composition** across eight food categories:

- **Reference Diet**: Represents a baseline or current average dietary intake, based on FAO Diet Composition Statistics ([FAO, 2013](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FBS)) calibrated for this analysis  
- **Healthy Diet**: Updated plant-forward diet with adjusted caloric proportions, based on [WHO Healthy Diet Guidelines](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/healthy-diet) estimated by [Springmann et al. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0594-0) 
- **Mediterranean Diet**: Plant-forward with olive oil, grains, fruits, and modest meat and dairy, estimated based on general dietary guidelines  
- **Flexitarian Diet**: Mostly plant-based with moderate amounts of animal products, estimated based on general dietary guidelines

*Based on:* Eker, S., Reese, G., Obersteiner, M. (2019). Modelling the drivers of a widespread shift to sustainable diets. *Nature Sustainability*, 2(8), 725-735. [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-019-0331-1](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-019-0331-1)

This scenario explores how population-level dietary behaviour evolves through social and psychological drivers, with implications for global consumption patterns and its environmental impacts. Drawing on the behavioural framework by Eker et al. (2019), the model integrates these dynamics into a broader population model to examine the influence of:

- **Self-efficacy**: individuals' confidence in their ability to adopt a more sustainable diet  
- **Response efficacy**: belief that dietary change will lead to meaningful environmental or health benefits  
- **Perceived risks**: awareness of the consequences of consumption on health and climate  
- **Social norms**: the influence of the dietary behaviours of others within a social group  

The findings show that **social norms** and **self-efficacy** are the most influential drivers of widespread dietary change. As more individuals adopt plant-based diets, a tipping point can be reached through social reinforcement, accelerating the transition. This underscores the importance of value-driven actions and group identity over purely risk-based motivations in shaping global dietary patterns and reducing the environmental impacts of the food system.",Primary,Sliders,0,200,100,25,%,.0f,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Food loss and waste occur across the entire food supply chain - from initial production to final consumption. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), **food loss** refers to the decrease in edible food mass that takes place during production, post-harvest, and processing stages - primarily due to infrastructural, logistical, or technical constraints. In contrast, **food waste** occurs at the retail and consumption stages and is often driven by behavioral or economic factors, such as over-purchasing, portion sizes, or the discarding of food that is still safe and edible ([FAO, 2014](http://www.fao.org/platform-food-loss-waste)).

Earlier stages of the supply chain (e.g., primary production and post-harvest) are typically more prone to **food loss**, while the later stages - particularly **consumption** - are where **food waste** is most prevalent. Each stage presents both challenges and opportunities for reducing inefficiencies and improving the sustainability of food systems.

---

1. **Primary Production.** This is the stage where crops are harvested or animals are raised for food. *Losses occur due to:*  
- Pests, diseases, or extreme weather  
- Harvesting inefficiencies (e.g., overripe or underripe crops left behind)  
- Market or price fluctuations (e.g., food not harvested due to low market value)  
- Cosmetic standards (produce rejected due to shape/appearance)  

---

2. **Post-Harvest Handling & Storage.** This is the stage where food is collected, sorted, cleaned, and stored before further processing or transport. *Losses occur due to:*  
- Poor storage conditions (e.g., lack of refrigeration or pest protection)  
- Inadequate infrastructure (e.g., damaged transport, lack of cooling)  
- Delays that reduce freshness, especially for perishables  

---

3. **Processing & Packaging.** This is the stage where raw food is transformed into consumer-ready products (e.g., milling, canning, freezing). *Losses occur due to:*  
- Trimming and processing waste (e.g., peels, bones, offcuts)  
- Equipment inefficiencies or downtime  
- Quality control rejections  
- Overproduction or batch spoilage  

---

4. **Distribution & Retail.** This is the stage where food is transported to retailers and sold to consumers. *Losses occur due to:*  
- Damage during transport (e.g., spoilage, packaging failure)  
- Inadequate temperature control (cold chain issues)  
- Overstocking and expired goods at retail  
- Rejection of items that don't meet aesthetic or size standards  

---

5. **Consumption.** This is the stage where food is purchased, prepared, and eaten by consumers or served in food services. *Waste occurs due to:*  
- Over-purchasing or improper storage at home  
- Confusion over ""best before"" and ""use by"" labels  
- Plate waste in households, restaurants, and cafeterias  
- Cultural preferences and lack of awareness about waste ",Primary,Sliders,0,100,100,10,%,.0f,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Food loss and waste vary significantly across different food categories due to their unique characteristics, production processes, and resource requirements. Understanding these differences is crucial for targeting effective interventions and reducing the overall environmental impact of the food system. Each category's loss and waste have different implications for resource use such as land, water, and energy. Therefore, reducing waste in resource-intensive foods like pasture meat can yield larger environmental benefits compared to other categories. Tailoring food loss and waste reduction strategies to the specific vulnerabilities of each category is key for building a more sustainable food system.

1. **Pasture Meat**  
Meat from animals raised on grasslands, such as beef and lamb. These meats have a higher environmental impact due to extensive land and water use. Losses at the production stage can be particularly impactful given the long growth cycles and resource intensity.

---

2. **Crop Meat**  
Meat from animals primarily fed on crops like soy and corn, including chicken and pork. Generally, they have a lower environmental footprint than pasture meats but are vulnerable to losses during harvesting, processing, and distribution due to perishability and storage challenges.

---

3. **Dairy**  
Products made from milk, such as cheese, yogurt, and butter. Dairy farming contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions and water usage. Dairy products are highly perishable, making spoilage a major cause of loss in processing, transport, and retail stages.

---

4. **Eggs**  
A nutrient-rich food source from poultry, including chicken, duck, and quail eggs. Eggs have a lower environmental impact compared to meat but still require feed, water, and careful handling to minimize breakage and spoilage across the supply chain.

---

5. **Pulses**  
Protein-rich plant foods like lentils, beans, and chickpeas. Pulses improve soil health and have a low carbon footprint. Their longer shelf life makes them less prone to loss, though storage and processing conditions can still cause losses.

---

6. **Grains**  
Staple crops such as wheat, rice, corn, and oats. These are essential for global food security but some require high water usage and are susceptible to losses during harvesting and storage due to pests, moisture, or poor infrastructure.

---

7. **Vegetables and Fruits**  
A diverse group including leafy greens, root vegetables, and berries. Generally have a lower environmental impact, but their perishability leads to high losses and waste throughout harvesting, transport, storage, and consumption stages. Transport and refrigeration also contribute to their environmental footprint.

---

8. **Other Crops**  
Includes foods like nuts, sugar, coffee, and oils (palm, soybean, canola). Some, especially tropical crops like palm oil, have significant land-use impacts. Losses vary widely depending on processing complexity and storage conditions.

Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) are greenhouse gas concentration trajectories adopted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for its **Fifth Assessment Report (AR5)** in 2014. They serve as standardized scenarios for climate modeling and research, facilitating comparisons across studies by providing consistent assumptions about future **radiative forcing**  -  the difference between incoming solar radiation and the energy radiated back to space  -  measured in **watts per square meter (W/m2)** by the year 2100.

## The Four RCPs

The RCPs are named according to their radiative forcing levels in 2100:

- **RCP2.6**. A stringent mitigation scenario leading to a radiative forcing of **2.6 W/m2**. It assumes aggressive emissions reductions, including negative emissions technologies like carbon dioxide removal. It is the only RCP consistent with keeping global warming likely below 2 DegC above pre-industrial levels.

- **RCP4.5**. A stabilisation scenario where radiative forcing stabilizes at **4.5 W/m2** after 2100. It assumes that emissions peak around 2040 and then decline due to moderate mitigation efforts.

- **RCP6.0**. Another stabilization pathway, reaching **6.0 W/m2** by 2100. This scenario assumes more delayed and modest mitigation compared to RCP4.5.

- **RCP8.5**. A high-emissions, business-as-usual scenario, leading to **8.5 W/m2** by 2100. It assumes continued growth in greenhouse gas emissions without additional climate policies. RCP8.5 was initially intended to represent a worst-case baseline but is increasingly viewed as less plausible given recent trends in energy and emissions.

## Purpose and Application

The RCPs are **not forecasts or predictions**. Instead, they provide *plausible futures* for climate modeling, helping researchers explore the potential outcomes of different emissions pathways. They are used as inputs to **Earth System Models (ESMs)**, which simulate the physical climate system under each scenario.

Each RCP includes not just CO? concentrations, but also data on other greenhouse gases, aerosols, land use changes, and atmospheric chemistry. This comprehensive framework allows for integrated assessment of how climate change might affect physical systems, ecosystems, and human societies.

## Transition to SSP-RCP Framework

In more recent work, particularly the **Sixth Assessment Report (AR6)**, the RCPs have been paired with **Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)** to create a more integrated framework known as the **SSP-RCP matrix**. This combination allows for exploring how socioeconomic developments (like population, GDP, or technological change) interact with climate outcomes.",Secondary,Sliders,0,5,3,1,-,.0f,,1,2,3,4,RCP1.9,RCP2.6,RCP3.4,RCP4.5,RCP6,RCP8.5,,,

This table compares three dietary patterns in terms of their **caloric composition** across eight food categories:

- **Reference Diet**: Represents a baseline or current average dietary intake  
- **Flexitarian Diet**: Mostly plant-based with moderate amounts of animal products  
- **Mediterranean Diet**: Plant-forward with olive oil, grains, fruits, and modest meat and dairy

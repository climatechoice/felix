## Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)

Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) are greenhouse gas concentration trajectories adopted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for its **Fifth Assessment Report (AR5)** in 2014. They serve as standardized scenarios for climate modeling and research, facilitating comparisons across studies by providing consistent assumptions about future **radiative forcing**  -  the difference between incoming solar radiation and the energy radiated back to space  -  measured in **watts per square meter (W/m2)** by the year 2100.

### The Four RCPs

The RCPs are named according to their radiative forcing levels in 2100:

- **RCP2.6**. A stringent mitigation scenario leading to a radiative forcing of **2.6 W/m2**. It assumes aggressive emissions reductions, including negative emissions technologies like carbon dioxide removal. It is the only RCP consistent with keeping global warming likely below 2 DegC above pre-industrial levels.

- **RCP4.5**. A stabilisation scenario where radiative forcing stabilizes at **4.5 W/m2** after 2100. It assumes that emissions peak around 2040 and then decline due to moderate mitigation efforts.

- **RCP6.0**. Another stabilization pathway, reaching **6.0 W/m2** by 2100. This scenario assumes more delayed and modest mitigation compared to RCP4.5.

- **RCP8.5**. A high-emissions, business-as-usual scenario, leading to **8.5 W/m2** by 2100. It assumes continued growth in greenhouse gas emissions without additional climate policies. RCP8.5 was initially intended to represent a worst-case baseline but is increasingly viewed as less plausible given recent trends in energy and emissions.

### Purpose and Application

The RCPs are **not forecasts or predictions**. Instead, they provide *plausible futures* for climate modeling, helping researchers explore the potential outcomes of different emissions pathways. They are used as inputs to **Earth System Models (ESMs)**, which simulate the physical climate system under each scenario.

Each RCP includes not just CO? concentrations, but also data on other greenhouse gases, aerosols, land use changes, and atmospheric chemistry. This comprehensive framework allows for integrated assessment of how climate change might affect physical systems, ecosystems, and human societies.

### Transition to SSP-RCP Framework

In more recent work, particularly the **Sixth Assessment Report (AR6)**, the RCPs have been paired with **Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)** to create a more integrated framework known as the **SSP-RCP matrix**. This combination allows for exploring how socioeconomic developments (like population, GDP, or technological change) interact with climate outcomes."

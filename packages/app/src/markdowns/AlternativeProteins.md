### Overview and Structure 
The **Alternative Protein Scenario** explores the transition from traditional animal-based proteins to alternative protein technologies. The scenario highlights the technological influences of food production and how they cascade through the agricultural system to influence land use. It allows the exploration of different adoption trajectories and their implications for food system sustainability.

This scenario is structured around four key stages:

1. **Replacement Demand of Animal Proteins with Alternative Proteins**: This are scenario inputs, determining the changing market share of animal proteins replaced by alternative proteins (by 2050 and 2100).
	* *Animal-based proteins*: [Pasture-based Meat, Crop-based Meat, Dairy, Eggs]
	* *See below for Replacement Matrix
2. **Replacement Supply of Alternative Protein Technologies**: This are also scenario input, being able to control the proportion of each animal food that can be met by developing AP technologies.
	* *Plant-based Proteins* (e.g. soy, pulses, grains)
	* *Precision Fermentation* (e.g. microbial fermentation to produce dairy and egg analogs)
	* *Cultivated Meat* (e.g. lab-grown muscle cells)
	* *See below for Replacement Matrix
3. **Changing Caloric Demand for Food**: This will be part of the direct ouputs, determining demand for different food categories after replacing animal food with crops that are used for Alternative Proteins technology.
   * *See below for estimated crop demands for each AP types
4. **Impacts**: Finally, we examine the wide range of impacts, particularly land use.

> *Note*: Plant-based and precision fermentation primarily replace processed foods and ingredient-based uses, while cultivated meat can begin to replace certain whole cuts and **center-of-plate products.

**Feedstock and Crop Demand for Alternative Proteins**

Each technology type shifts demand toward specific crop categories:
- **Plant-based**: Pulses (peas, lentils), grains (soy, wheat), vegetable oils
- **Precision Fermentation**: Sugars (glucose, sucrose), microbial substrates (e.g. starches)
- **Cultivated Meat**: Sugars, amino acids, growth media (often derived from maize, sugarcane, or soy)
